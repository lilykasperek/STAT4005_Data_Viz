## 10.1 Basic Reactivity

Read Sections 3.1 through 3.3 in the Basic Reactivity Chapter of Mastering Shiny

__Exercise 1.__ 3.3.6 Exercise 1 in Mastering Shiny.

Given this UI: Fix the simple errors found in each of the three server functions below. First try spotting the problem just by reading the code; then run the code to make sure youâ€™ve fixed it.

```{r}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  textOutput("greeting")
)

server1 <- function(input, output, server) {
  output$greeting <- renderText(paste0("Hello ", input$name))
}

shinyApp(ui, server1)

## The problem with server1 was that it had input instead of output before renderText, and it just had name instead of input$name in the parantheses. 

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  textOutput("greeting")
)

server2 <- function(input, output, server) {
  greeting <- reactive(paste0("Hello ", input$name))
  output$greeting <- renderText(greeting())
}

shinyApp(ui, server2)

## The problem with server2 was that it was not wrapped inside a reactive expression. 

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  textOutput("greeting")
)

server3 <- function(input, output, server) {
  output$greeting <- renderText({
    paste0("Hello ", input$name)
})
}

shinyApp(ui, server3)

## The problem with server3 was that greeting was misspelled in the output, Hello needs a space after it, and there was no reactive renderText output. 
```

__Exercise 2.__ 3.3.6 Exercise 2 in Mastering Shiny.

```{r}
## Draw the reactive graph for the following server functions:

server1 <- function(input, output, session) {
  c <- reactive(input$a + input$b)
  e <- reactive(c() + input$d)
  output$f <- renderText(e())
}

## Inputs a and b connect to reactive c. Reactive c connects to reactive e. Input d connects to reactive e. Reactive e connects to output f. 

server2 <- function(input, output, session) {
  x <- reactive(input$x1 + input$x2 + input$x3)
  y <- reactive(input$y1 + input$y2)
  output$z <- renderText(x() / y())
}

## Inputs x1, x2, and x3 connect to reactive x. Reactive x connects to output z. Inputs y1 and y2 connect to reactive y. Reactive y connects to output z. 

server3 <- function(input, output, session) {
  d <- reactive(c() ^ input$d)
  a <- reactive(input$a * 10)
  c <- reactive(b() / input$c) 
  b <- reactive(a() + input$b)
}

## Input d connects to output d. Input a connects to reactive a, which connects to reactive b, which connects to reactive c, which connects to output d. Input c connects to reactive c, which connects to output d. Input b connects to reactive b, which connects to reactive c, which connects to output d. 
```
